## Overview

Our testing strategy aims to ensure the reliability, functionality, and maintainability of the Rodeo Chatbot. We employ a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover various aspects of the system.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation. They are located in the `tests/` directory and typically have a one-to-one correspondence with the modules in the `src/rodeo/` directory.

Key areas covered by unit tests:
- CLI argument parsing
- Chat class methods
- Utility functions

Example: `tests/test_cli.py`

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work together correctly. They are primarily located in `tests/test_integration.py`.

Key areas covered by integration tests:
- CLI and Chat class interaction
- Session persistence
- Command processing pipeline

Example: `tests/test_integration.py`

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real-world usage of the chatbot. They interact with the system as a user would, typically through the CLI interface.

Key areas covered by end-to-end tests:
- Full conversation flows
- CLI input/output
- Error handling and edge cases

Example: `tests/test_e2e.py` (if implemented)

## Test Files

- `tests/test_cli.py`: Unit tests for CLI functionality
- `tests/test_chat.py`: Unit tests for the Chat class
- `tests/test_integration.py`: Integration tests
- `tests/test_e2e.py`: End-to-end tests (if implemented)

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```
pytest tests/
```

To run a specific test file:

```
pytest tests/test_file_name.py
```

To run a specific test function:

```
pytest tests/test_file_name.py::test_function_name
```

## Writing New Tests

When adding new features or modifying existing ones:

1. Start by writing unit tests for the new/modified components.
2. Update or add integration tests to cover the interaction of the new/modified components with the rest of the system.
3. If the change affects the overall user experience, consider adding or updating end-to-end tests.

Use descriptive test names and include docstrings explaining the purpose of each test.

## Continuous Integration

(Note: Implement this section when CI is set up)

We use [CI Tool Name] for continuous integration. All tests are automatically run on each push to the repository. PRs cannot be merged unless all tests pass.

## Best Practices

1. Maintain test independence: Each test should be able to run independently of others.
2. Use mocking judiciously: Mock external dependencies, but be cautious not to over-mock, which can lead to tests that don't reflect real-world behavior.
3. Keep tests fast: Optimize tests to run quickly to encourage frequent running.
4. Test edge cases: Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios.
5. Maintain test coverage: Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize critical paths and complex logic.
6. Refactor tests: Keep tests clean and maintainable. Refactor as needed when the main code changes.
7. Use parametrized tests: For similar tests with different inputs, use pytest's parametrize feature.

Remember, tests are a critical part of our development process. They help catch bugs early, document expected behavior, and make it easier to refactor and improve our code with confidence.
